Amazon-Search-Engine-and-Recommondation
It is a machine learning project based on nltk , natural processing language, tokenization, etc. This project also gives us recommendations that which product you wanna buy and also search for the perfect product for the user. Here I used a CSV file for the data set and from the data words will be extracted then from the data I will extract the words to compare the similarities between them to give the result.

# Amazon-Search-Engine-and-Recommondation
It is a machine learning project based on nltk ,natural processing language, tokenization etc. This project also gives us a recommendations that which product you wanna buy and also search the perfect product for the user. Here I used CSV file for data set and from the data words will be extracted then form the data it will extract the words to compare the similarities between them for giving the result.
